# fix for newer automake which doesn't seem to work well when called
# recursively.
# what was happening is that the TEST_LOGS at the top level were sent
# to sub-levels and caused errors like
#
# fatal: making test-suite.log: failed to create test-canonicalize-package.trs
# fatal: making test-suite.log: failed to create test-canonicalize-package.log
#
# so this fixes that by zeroing out the TEST_LOGS
