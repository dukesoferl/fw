Version 0.9.6
  * compare revision of the tag with HEAD to decide a existing tag

Version 0.9.5
  * another attempt at fixing the gcc/libtool dependency closure issues

Version 0.9.4
  * minor fixups to work with Centos7 and the automake version it includes

Version 0.9.3
  * dependency-range has deviated from dependency closure and was causing
  certain packages to fail to build

Version 0.9.2
  * dependency closure was failing if a package provides 2 versions, so now
  keep track of the second version and have closure check both.

Version 0.9.1
  * set environment variable LC_COLLATE to use a single sort order regardless
    of environment

Version 0.9.0
  * added meta packages
  * added package version requirements to rpm installing command

Version 0.8.3
  * rpm/make-package: Don't exclude versioned directories from RPM ownership.

Version 0.8.2
  * Fix parsing of dependency versions that contain extra whitespace
    inside parens or square brackets.
  * Die on unparseable dependency specifications.
  * Change rpmevrcmp to consider any installed version release part to
    be equal to a missing dependency version release part.

Version 0.8.1
  * getdeps was failing for C packages, make it not fail, but not work either

Version 0.8.0
  * support FW_PACKAGE_ORGANIZATION as a config variable
  * support FW_PACKAGE_PACKAGER as a config variable
  * use these in RPM packaging

Version 0.7.1
  * maxtries needs to be higher for getdeps

Version 0.7.0
  * Added a script called fw-reset-to-base which will attempt to reset an
  RPM based system to the file containing a list of rpms given to it via the
  command line.

Version 0.6.0
  * Added an environment variable which will set the Release field in an RPM
  spec file, FW_PACKAGE_RELEASE_VERSION, allowing CI systems like bamboo to
  set it with their build # when building a package
  * added an option to the generated configure '--enable-getdeps' which will
  pull dependencies using sudo yum install
  * fix for rpmvercmp by David Hull

Version 0.5.4
  * add a post release hook for running commands

Version 0.5.3
  * Another change for centos6, for some reason cpio behavior seems to have
  changed so that links were not being copied, this led to errors in templates
  so now explicitly pass '-L' to cpio.

Version 0.5.2
  * one more change for centos6, don't add %dir entries for existing system
  directories

Version 0.5.1
  * a couple of minor fixes for centos 6

Version 0.5.0
  * if environment variable FW_SKIP_TAG is non-empty then allow release to
  release an already tagged source tree

  repo, just build release rpms locally

Version 0.4.3
  * fix issues with rpm build packages

Version 0.4.2
  * Correctly escape blank lines in Description field of debian control file

Version 0.4.1
  * consistent sort for ignore-files

Version 0.4.0
  * add none as a template type, the none template is even more minimal than
  script, it does not contain tests or src directory and is mostly useful for
  packaging config files or for cases where you want autotools but no initial
  layout
  * fix rpm errors caused by changes in version 0.3.2

Version 0.3.4
  * add --ignore-unmatch to revision/git/remove-files

Version 0.3.3
  * adjust for newer svn client behaviour difference
     (latest versions want to delete the local file, therefore
      REVISION/remove-files will have new semantics, namely, 
      deleting the file from the local filesystem; adjust
      see-vee-ess and none accordingly)

Version 0.3.2
  * some tweaks to build on later os/x

Version 0.3.1 (molinaro)
  * couldn't test release without proper framewerk, then there was a problem
with the git detect script, release should properly tag and work now

Version 0.3.0 (molinaro)
  * git added as a revision system

Version 0.2.11 (molinaro)
  * rpm version comparison was using '==' to compare 2 strings which led to
    silent errors.

Version 0.2.10 (molinaro)
  * Wrong license, the web page claimed new BSD, the distro had GPLv2, I talk
    to Paul and he wanted new BSD, so this has that license.

Version 0.2.9 (molinaro)
  * For whatever reason 'make install' was failing, well okay the reason was
    the variable for the directory to install some things was wrong, however
    it still seemed to build rpms fine, so I didn't catch it.

Version 0.2.8 (molinaro)
  * when installing multiple packages with the same prefix, the %posttrans
    for the first package would remove files for the second resulting in
    errors, so be a little be more precise in what gets removed

Version 0.2.7 (molinaro)
  * rpm reverse_provides was unimplemented, providing an implementation

Version 0.2.6 (molinaro)
  * Allow parens in package lists for provides and conflicts
  * turn off debuginfo packages when building rpms on redhat, framewerk does
    not deal with them correctly

Version 0.2.5 (molinaro)
  * when upgrading rpms, the wrong version was being passed to newpostremove,
    need to pass old version not new version for upgrades to work
  * rpm provides were mislabeled as conflicts so causing issues

Version 0.2.4
  * remove X from svn check-up-to-date

Version 0.2.3 
  * fw-template installed test fix

Version 0.2.2
  * quote metacharacters in cvs add
  * cant use '::' with ac-init.generated b/c of am__aclocal_m4_deps :(
